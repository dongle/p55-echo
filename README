 A re-implementation of the Echo effect in Adobe After Effects in processing.
 Takes a directory of a series of TIFFs and spits out a series of processed TIFFs.
 Blends and fades previous frames to create a dreamy swirl as seen at http://vimeo.com/22928669.
 Works best with things shot against an alpha.
 
 Setup contains some nifty switches to flip like resolution & blendmode etc.
